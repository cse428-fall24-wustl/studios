<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSE 428S: Studio 3<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Control Flow and Debugging</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

  <p>In today's studio you will explore how to track program control flow and
    corresponding changes to program state, using the <code>gdb</code> debugger.
    Specifically, you will build and run and trace a program that implements a
    simple prefix addition calculator for expressions involving symbols for an
    addition (<code>+</code>) operator and unsigned integers, which are given to
    the program as command line arguments.
    Your experience running using <code>gdb</code> to trace program behavior will
    help you prepare to dubug program behavior in your subsequent lab and studio
    assignments this semester, especially if you complete the optional enrichment
    exercises where you will trace the program's behavior using  <code>gdb</code>
    in  <code>emacs</code>, or using the Visual Studio debugger available on the
    windows machines in some of the teaching labs in Urbauer Hall.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<p>
Please complete the following required exercises. I encourage you to please 
work in groups of 2 or 3 people on each studio (and the groups are allowed to change from studio to studio) though if you would prefer to complete any studio by yourself that is also allowed.</p>

<p>As you work through these exercises, please record your answers, and when
  you finish them please log into Canvas, select this course in this semester, and
  then upload a <code>.txt</code> file containing your answers on the Canvas page
  for this studio assignment. <strong>Only one submission per team, please, and if
  you need to re-submit it the person who originally submitted the studio should
  please be the one to do that.</strong></p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.

<li>
<p>First, ssh into <code>shell.cec.wustl.edu</code> using your WUSTL
  Key id and password and then use <code>qlogin</code> to log into one
  of the Linux Lab machines and then confirm that the version of <code>g++</code>
  there is correct (as you did in <a href="studio0.html">Studio 0</a>). Then
  <code>cd</code> into your directory for this course this semester, create a new
  subdirectory for this studio, and <code>cd</code> into it.
  
<P>Copy the <code>Makefile</code> from your <a href="studio0.html">Studio 0</a>
  directory into that directory and update it so that it will build an executable
  program called <code>studio3</code> from the following
  <code><a href="studio3.h">studio3.h</a></code> header file and
  <code><a href="studio3.cpp">studio3.cpp</a></code>) source file, both of which
  you should also copy into that directory.

<p>Compile the program, checking that the <code>Makefile</code> caused
  <code>make</code> to pass the <code>-g</code> flag (to embed debugging information
  for <code>gdb</code> to use) when it called <code>g++</code>. Run the compiled
  program with a command line consisting of multiple space-separated addition
  (<code>+</code>) operators and unsigned integers that make up a valid prefix addition
  expression (there should be one more unsigned integer than the number of addition
  operators, and the ith addition operator should always be to the left of the ith
  unsigned integer). Then, immediately issue the following command to confirm that the
  program returned 0 to indicate success:

  <P><code>echo $?</code>

  <P>Run the program again, but with an invalid prefix addition expression (e.g., by
  removing one of the unsigned integers from the command line so that there are
  too few of them, or rearranging the command line so that one of the unsigned
  integers appears before its corresponding addition operator), and then immediately
  issue the <code>echo $?</code> command to confirm that the program returned a
  non-zero value to indicate failure.

  <P>As the answer to this exercise please show the command lines that were used to 
    run the program both successfully and unsuccessfully, and for each of them show
    the output the program produced and the value it returned.
  
<li>
  <p>Use the <code>gdb studio3</code> command to load the program within the
    <code>gdb</code> debugger, and as the answer to this exercise please show
    the lines that appeared within the terminal window where you ran that command,
    when you did that.

<li>
  <p>Within <code>gdb</code>, issue the <code>break parse_and_compute</code> command to
    set a breakpoint that will stop the debugger whenever the program's
    <code>parse_and_compute</code> function is called, which it will be multiple times
    (recursively) as the program parses and computes the prefix addition expression
    that was given on its command line. As the answer to this exercise please show
    the additional lines that were printed within the terminal window when you ran
    that command.

    <li>
      <p>Within <code>gdb</code>, issue the command <code>run + 1 + 2 + 3 4 </code>
        to run the program, and then issue the <code>continue</code> command to cause
        the debugger to run it further until the next breakpoint is reached. As the
        answer to this exercise please show the additional lines that were printed
        within the terminal window when you ran those commands.

<li>
  <p>Within <code>gdb</code>, issue the <code>where</code> command to display the
    program's call stack at the current point in its execution, and as the answer to this
    exercise please show the additional lines that were printed within the terminal
    window when you ran that command.

<li>
  <p>Review the source file (and/or today's
    <a href="https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse428/Control_Flow_and_Debugging.pptx">lecture
    slides</a>) to determine what the appropriate expressions are for (1) the
    position (index) of the current command line argument that is being parsed,
    and (2) the (C-style) string corresponding to that command line argument. 
    Within <code>gdb</code>, then use the <code>print</code> command twice to
    display the values of those expressions, and as the answer to this
    exercise please show the additional lines that were printed within the terminal
    window when you did that.

    
<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>

<li>
  <p>Use the <code>step</code> and <code>next</code> commands within <code>gdb</code>
    to step into and step over different statements and functions in the program.
    As the answer to this exercise, please note any interesting things you noticed
    when you did that, including whether you were able to step all the way down into
    the assembly code for funtions that the program uses but that do not appear in
    its compiled source file (e.g., that the program gets from the C++ libraries).
    
<li>
  <p>Repeat any of the required or optional exercises above after opening the program
    source
    and header files in <code>emacs</code> and running the <code>gdb</code> debugger
    from within <code>emacs</code> as shown in the lecture slides. As the answer to
    this exercise please describe briefly what you did, and any useful features that
    <code>emacs</code> provided when running the <code>gdb</code> debugger
    from within it.

<li>
  <p>Repeat any of the required or optional exercises above after transfering the
    program source
    and header files onto one of the Windows machines available in the Urbauer Hall
    teaching labs, compiling them in Visual Studio into a terminal window application
    (you will need to add <code>#include "stdafx.h"</code> to the top of your source
    file), and then stepping through the program using Visual Studio's debugging
    features.  As the answer to this exercise please describe briefly what you did,
    and any useful features that Visual Studio provided when debugging your program.
