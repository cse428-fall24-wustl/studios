<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSE 428S: Studio 12<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Types and Generic Programming</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

  <p>Today's lecture and studio focus on type declaration and usage issues that may
    arise when specifying and using different expressions, variables, and parameters.
    These issues are essential to the generic programming paradigm that we will
    consider for the rest of this semester, and addressing them establishes foundations
    for how type-related issues can be managed in C++ which we will expand on in
    later topics.
    
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<p>
  Please complete the following required exercises. I encourage you to please work in
  groups of 2 or 3 people on each studio (and the groups are allowed to change from
  studio to studio) though if you would prefer to complete any studio by yourself that
  is also allowed.</p>

<p>As you work through these exercises, please record your answers, and when
  you finish them please log into Canvas, select this course in this semester, and
  then upload a <code>.txt</code> file containing your answers on the Canvas page
  for this studio assignment. <strong>Only one submission per team, please, and if
  you need to re-submit it the person who originally submitted the studio should
  please be the one to do that.</strong></p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.

<li><p>First, ssh into <code>shell.cec.wustl.edu</code> using your WUSTL
  Key id and password and then use <code>qlogin</code> to log into one
  of the Linux Lab machines and then confirm that the version of <code>g++</code>
  there is correct (as you did in <a href="studio0.html">Studio 0</a>). Then
  <code>cd</code> into your directory for this course this semester, create a new
  subdirectory for this studio, and <code>cd</code> into it.
  
  <P>Copy the <code>Makefile</code> from one of your previous studios into that
    directory, and add a source file for your program's main function.  As you
    work on this studio, please update the Makefile as needed so that it will build an
    executable program called <code>studio12</code> from the files in that directory.

  <P>Add a source file to your directory, and in it define a main function that declares
    the following variables on separate lines of code:</P>
    
    <ol>
      <li>A <code>const int</code>
        variable initialized with the value 0</li>
      <li>A non-const <code>int</code> variable
        initialized with the value 1</li>
      <li>A <code>const</code> pointer to a
        <code>const int</code> variable initialized with the address of the
        <code>const int</code> variable</li>
      <li>A <code>const</code> pointer to a
        <code>const int</code> variable initialized with the address of the non-const
        <code>int</code> variable</li>
      <li>A <code>const</code> pointer to a non-const
        <code>int</code> variable initialized with the address of the
        <code>const int</code> variable</li>
      <li>A <code>const</code> pointer to a
        non-const <code>int</code> variable initialized with the address of the
        non-const <code>int</code> variable</li>
      <li>A non-const pointer to a
        <code>const int</code> variable initialized with the address of the
        <code>const int</code> variable</li>
      <li>A non-const pointer to a
        <code>const int</code> variable initialized with the address of the non-const
        <code>int</code> variable</li>
      <li>A non-const pointer to a non-const
        <code>int</code> variable initialized with the address of the
        <code>const int</code> variable</li>
      <li>A non-const pointer to a
        non-const <code>int</code> variable initialized with the address of the
        non-const <code>int</code> variable</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    The main function should then (in separate lines of code) print to <code>cout</code>
    the values of the <code>const int</code> and non-const <code>int</code> variables,
    and for each of the pointers the address it contains followed by the value of what
    it points to.
    </p>
    
  <P>Try to build your program, and comment out any lines that will not compile.
    As the answer to this exercise please show the lines that had to be commented out,
    and for each of them explain briefly why it could not be compiled.

   <li>
     <p>In your main function, after the output statements that remain, write separate
       statements (on separate lines of code) that use the prefix <code>++</code>
       operator (which is built-in for <code>int</code> and pointer types) to modify
       the value of each of the variables whose declarations were not commented out,
       and for the pointer variables add a separate statement that modifies what the
       pointer points to.

     <P>Try to build your program, and again comment out any of the newly added lines
       that will not compile.
    As the answer to this exercise please show the lines that had to be commented out,
    and for each of them explain briefly why it could not be compiled.

   <li>
     <p>In your main function, after the declaration of each of the integer and pointer
       variables, add another declaration (on a separate line of code) for another
       variable that is declared using the <code>auto</code> type specifier and is
       initialized with the original variable.

       <P>For each of those variables that was declared using the <code>auto</code> type
       specifier, use the prefix <code>++</code> operator to determine whether or not
       it can be modified (and in the case of pointer types also to determine whether
       or not what it points to can be modified).

     <P>Try to build your program, and again comment out any of the newly added lines
       that will not compile.
       As the answer to this exercise please explain whether or not either low-level
       const or top-level const properties were discarded in any of the declarations
       that used the <code>auto</code> type specifier and if they were show the
       declaration and explain briefly which of them was discarded and how you know
       that.


    <li>
      <p>In your main function, replace the <code>auto</code> type specifier with the
        the <code>decltype</code> type specifier in each of the declarations that
        you added in the previous exercise.

      <P>For each of the variables in those declarations, again use the prefix
        <code>++</code> operator to determine whether or not it can be modified
        (and in the case of pointer types also to determine whether
       or not what it points to can be modified).

     <P>Try to build your program, and again comment out any of the newly added lines
       that will not compile. As the answer to this exercise please explain whether
       (and if so how) the use of the <code>decltype</code> type specifier differed from
       the use of the <code>auto</code> type specifier, in terms of whether or not
       either low-level const or top-level const properties were discarded in any of
       the declarations.

   <li>
     <p>Add typedefs for the following types to your main program: <code>int</code>,
       <code>const int</code>, <code>const</code> pointer to <code>int</code>,
       <code>const</code> pointer to <code>const int</code>, non-const pointer to
       <code>int</code>, and non-const pointer to <code>const int</code>. 

       <P>In your main function, replace the type portion of the declaration of each of
       the integer and pointer variables with the appropriate one of those type aliases.
       
       <P>Compile and run your program, and as the answer to this exercise please show
         the declarations that use those type aliases.
