<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSE 428S: Studio 6<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Classes</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

  <p>In today's studio you will begin a series of topics focused on object-oriented
    programming, with a basic review of C++ structs and classes, access specifications,
    and constructors.

  <p>Please complete the following required exercises. I
encourage you to please work in groups of 2 or 3 people on each studio
(and the groups are allowed to change from studio to studio) though if
you would prefer to complete any studio by yourself that is also
allowed.</p>

<p>As you work through these exercises, please record your answers, and when
  you finish them please log into Canvas, select this course in this semester, and
  then upload a <code>.txt</code> file containing your answers on the Canvas page
  for this studio assignment. <strong>Only one submission per team, please, and if
  you need to re-submit it the person who originally submitted the studio should
  please be the one to do that.</strong></p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.
    
<li><p>First, ssh into <code>shell.cec.wustl.edu</code> using your WUSTL
  Key id and password and then use <code>qlogin</code> to log into one
  of the Linux Lab machines and then confirm that the version of <code>g++</code>
  there is correct (as you did in <a href="studio0.html">Studio 0</a>). Then
  <code>cd</code> into your directory for this course this semester, create a new
  subdirectory for this studio, and <code>cd</code> into it.

  <P>Create a new header file and source file in your directory for this studio,
    and in the header file declare a struct with two integer member variables. Do not
    add <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, or <code>public</code>
    access specifications, or any constructors, methods, or operators, or initialize
    the member variables – we will first look at basic semantics of a struct or class
    and will then explore additional features.

  <P>Add a new source file to your directory for this studio, and in it (1) include
    the newly created header file and (2) define your program's main function and
    in it declare a variable of the struct type and then print out its member
    variables using cout.

  <p>Copy over the <code>Makefile</code> from one of your previous studios into
    your directory and update it appropriately, then try to build and run your
    program and note any compiler warnings or compiler errors that were given.

    <P>Then (in the header and source files for the struct, respectively)
    declare and define a default constructor that initializes the
    member variables to 0 using the base class / member initialization
    list (not the constructor body).

     <P>Again try to build and run your program, and
       as the answer to this exercise, please describe what happened before and
       after you added the constructor (including any compiler warnings or errors you saw
       in either case, and if you are able to get either variation
    to build and run, what values were printed out and where you think they came from.

<li><p>Change the declaration in the header file from a struct to a class, still
       without adding any private, public, or protected declarations, and try to build
       and run your program.  Then try putting a public vs. protected vs. private
       declaration before the member variables within the class declaration, and try
       to build and run your program.  As the answer to this exercise, please explain
       the difference between a struct vs. a class and describe how that difference
       explains which access specifications (public vs. protected vs. private) need to
       be used to make member variables (and member functions) visible outside a class.

<li><p>Change the class declaration to have private member variables, and for each of
        the member variables add a public "accessor" member function (which takes no
        parameters and returns an <code>int</code>) and a public "mutator" member
        function (which takes an <code>int</code> type  return that assigns the
        member variable the passed value and then returns a reference to the current
        object that contains the member variables (e.g., <code>return *this;</code>.
        Declare the accessor methods to be <code>const</code> (by putting the keyword
        <code>const</code> after the closing parenthesis).

      <P>In your program's main function, try calling the accessor and mutator
        methods on const and non-const objects of the class type and remove statements
        that do not work, leaving the ones that do (the accessors should work on both,
        but the mutators should only work on non-const objects). Use those methods
        to print out the member variables’ original values, and for non-const objects
        to set those values to something different (and then print out the new values
        of the member variables). As the answer to this exercise, please show (1) your
        code for this and (2) what the program printed out.
        
<li><p>In your main function, try out the following operations (using the class name
    and accessors and mutators from your declaration, rather than as given below),
    printing out the values of the variables after each line.<P>
    
    <code>MyClass m; // default construction</code><P>
    <code>cout << "m.x is " << m.x() << " and m.y is " << m.y() << endl;</code><P>
    <code>m.x(7).y(3); // chained use of mutator functions</code><P>
    <code>cout << "m.x is " << m.x() << " and m.y is " << m.y() << endl;</code><P>
    <code>MyClass n(m); // copy construction</code><P>
    <code>cout << "n.x = " << n.x() << " and n.y = " << n.y() << endl;</code><P>

    Build and run your program and as the answer to this exercise, please explain what
    each of the compiler-supplied (i.e., it provides them if you don’t) default
    constructor and copy constructor is doing, based on the output you saw.

<li><p>Declare and define (in your header and source files respectively) a copy
    constructor for the class that takes a const reference to another object of the
    same type and initializes its member variables (again in the base-member
    initialization list) to have the values of the member variables of the object
    from which the current object is being constructed; make sure to use the
    base-member initialization list for initializing member variables in the copy
    constructor (instead of assigning them in the body of the constructor).

    <p>Declare and define a default constructor using <code>= default;</code></p>

    <P>Compile and run your program, and as the answer to this exercise, please
      explain what happens compared to the compiler-supplied version of the copy
      constructor that you saw in the previous exercise, when you run the same code
      statements as above.

<li><p>Add statements to your default constructor and copy constructor that
print out (1) the signature of each of them, (2) the memory address
of the object (<code>this</code>), and (3) the values of the object's member
    variables, to <code>cout</code>.

    <P>Add a function that takes an object of your class by value and returns that
    object by value (i.e., the function's return type is the class type), and then
      in your main function call that function (1) with the original object
      immediately after you default construct it but before its mutator member functions
      are called, (2) with the original object immediately after its mutator member
      functions are called, and then (3) with the copy constructed object immediately
      after it is created.

    <P>Build and run your program, and as the answer to this exercise, please
       say which of the constructor methods are called, and in what order,
       when objects are created in main, are passed by value and are returned by value.

<li><p>As the answer to
this exercise, please try out the following using the code you
developed for the previous exercise, and answer each question. What happens if
you declare your default constructor private but do not define it? Can
you still create variables of that type? Does the compiler still
supply a default constructor that can be used by statements in your
main function?
